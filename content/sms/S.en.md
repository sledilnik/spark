# Spark S

Among the COVID-19-specific symptoms listed below, mark the ones you have for yourself. Also select the date of onset of symptoms.

You will send information about your symptoms in an SMS to people you have been in contact with in the last 14 days. Each recipient of the message will consider whether they were in contact with you 48 hours before the onset of your first symptom; it is a time when infectiousness usually occurs and therefore transmission of the infection is possible. On the other hand, among other people to whom you will send an SMS, there may be someone who will identify himself as the source of your infection.

With the help of SMS, you inform the people you may have infected, as well as look for your source of infection.
