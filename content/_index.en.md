# Check and choose:

Check to see if any of the situations below apply to you. If they do, follow the instructions.

{{% collapsable id="spark-s" summary="**Symptomatic case:** I have a symptom that is typical for COVID-19." %}}
You can [check]({{< ref "pages/simptoms" >}}) what symptoms are typical for COVID-19.

Try to isolate yourself for 10 days and consult with your personal doctor about the symptoms. Send an SMS {{< sms_link S >}} to all of your contacts that you have 
have seen in person in the last 14 days.

If you are tested re-report your status. In the case of positive test send {{< sms_link P >}}
(see also "Positive case"), otherwise send {{< sms_link N >}}.

In the future, if you match the criteria for the "Root", i.e. you received 3 or more Spark S/P messages, then send {{< sms_link R >}}.
{{% /collapsable %}}

{{% collapsable id="spark-p" summary="**Positive case:** I was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2." %}}
Follow the epidemiologist's recommendations, isolate yourself and send people you have been in contact with in the last 14 days
SMS {{<sms_link P>}}.
If you installed the mobile application [#OstaniZdrav](https://www.gov.si/teme/koronavirus-sars-cov-2/mobilna-aplikacija-ostanizdrav/)
then apply for a TAN code and enter it in the application. In this way, you will also inform unknown persons who may be infected by you.

In the future, if you match the criteria for the "Root", i.e. you received 3 or more Spark S/P messages, then send {{< sms_link R >}}.
{{% /collapsable %}}

{{% collapsable id="spark-a" summary="**Asymptomatic case:** I received the Spark R message ..." %}}
... from a person that was possibly infectious and I was in contact with in the last 9 days.

The person who sent you the Spark R message may be the source of a major spread of the virus. Because you were in contact with him/her,
there's a good chance he/she infected you too. If you are infected, it is possible that you have not developed symptoms (yet). 
However, you may have unknowingly transmited the virus further.

If your employer approves, try to self-isolate for at least 5 days and work from home. People you have been in
contact with in the last 7 days, send an SMS {{<sms_link A>}}. 

In the event that you subsequently receive a Spark N message (negative test) 
from the person who previously sent you the Spark R message and you still feel healthy, 
pass the message on to your contacts with {{<sms_link N>}}.

In the future, if you match the criteria for the "Root", i.e. you recived 3 or more Spark S/P messages, then send {{< sms_link R >}}.
{{% /collapsable %}}


{{% collapsable id="spark-r" summary="**Root:** I received 3 or more Spark S/P messages ..." %}}
... from different people that I was in contact with in the period from 5 days ago to 9 days ago.

There is a high probability that you are infected. You may have been infected by these people, but you may be the source of their
infection and you may have infected someone else besides them.

If your employer approves, try to self-isolate for at least 5 days and work from home. People you have been in
contact with in the last 7 days, send an SMS {{<sms_link R>}}. 
If you are tested re-report your status. In the case of positive test send {{< sms_link P >}}
(see also "Positive case"), otherwise send {{< sms_link N >}}.
{{% /collapsable %}}

{{% collapsable id="spark-k" summary="**Kontakt:** I recieved a Spark S, Spark P or Spark A message ..." %}}
... from a person that was possibly infectious and I was in contact with in the last 5 days.

The person who sent you this message has either symptoms specific to COVID-19 (Spark S), is positive on the new
coronavirus (Spark P) or is asymptomatic but has been informed that he/she has been in contact with a potentil
superspreader (Spark A).

Since you have been in contact with the sender recently, try to arrange work from home with your employer and self-isolate for at least 5 days. 
This is the period of greatest danger to others, when symptoms are usually not yet present, but we may transmit the virus. 
Your self-isolation is therefore especially important, as it will break the transmission chain of transmission you were just informed about. 
You don't need to send **Spark** messages at this time.

If symptoms occur, act in accordance with "Symptomatic case". In case you receive a Spark message
R, follow instructions for "Asymptomatic case". If you subsequently receive multiple Spark S/P messages,
follow the "Root".
