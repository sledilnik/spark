summary: "**Asymptomatic case:** I received the Spark R message ..."
class: spark-a

... from a person that was possibly contagious and I was in contact with in the last 9 days.

The person who sent you the Spark R message may be the source of a major spread of the virus. Because you were in contact with him/her,
there's a good chance he/she infected you too. If you are infected, it is possible that you have not developed symptoms (yet). 
However, you may have unknowingly transmited the virus further.

If your employer approves, try to self-isolate for at least 5 days and work from home. People you have been in
contact with in the last 7 days, send an SMS {{<sms_link A>}}. 

In the event that you subsequently receive a Spark N message (negative test) 
from the person who previously sent you the Spark R message and you still feel healthy, 
pass the message on to your contacts with {{<sms_link N>}}.

In the future, if you match the criteria for the "Root", i.e. you recived 3 or more Spark S/P messages, then send {{< sms_link R >}}.
