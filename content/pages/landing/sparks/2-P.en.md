Follow the epidemiologist's recommendations, isolate yourself and send people you have been in contact with in the last 14 days
SMS {{<sms_link P>}}.
If you installed the mobile application [#OstaniZdrav](https://www.gov.si/teme/koronavirus-sars-cov-2/mobilna-aplikacija-ostanizdrav/)
then apply for a TAN code and enter it in the application. In this way, you will also inform unknown persons who may be infected by you.

In the future, if you match the criteria for the "Root", i.e. you received 3 or more Spark S/P messages, then send {{< sms_link R >}}.
