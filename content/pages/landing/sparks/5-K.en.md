... from a person that was possibly contagious and I was in contact with in the last 5 days.

The person who sent you this message has either symptoms specific to COVID-19 (Spark S), is positive on the new
coronavirus (Spark P) or is asymptomatic but has been informed that he/she has been in contact with a potentil
superspreader (Spark A).

Since you have been in contact with the sender recently, try to arrange work from home with your employer and self-isolate for at least 5 days. 
This is the period of greatest danger to others, when symptoms are usually not yet present, but we may transmit the virus. 
Your self-isolation is therefore especially important, as it will break the transmission chain of transmission you were just informed about. 
You don't need to send ** Spark ** messages at this time.

If symptoms occur, act in accordance with "Symptomatic infection". In case you receive a Spark message
R, follow instructions for "Asymptomatic infection". If you subsequently receive multiple Spark S/P messages,
follow the "Root".
