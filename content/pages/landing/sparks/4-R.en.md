There is a high probability that you are infected. You may have been infected by these people, but you may be the source of their
infection and you may have infected someone else besides them.

If your employer approves, try to self-isolate for at least 5 days and work from home. People you have been in
contact with in the last 7 days, send an SMS {{<sms_link R>}}. 
If you are tested re-report your status. In the case of positive test send {{< sms_link P >}}
(see also "Positive case"), otherwise send {{< sms_link N >}}.
